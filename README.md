# CPPDS_Stack
A stack in C++ is a data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. You can push (add) and pop (remove) elements from the top. In C++, you can use `std::stack` from the Standard Library to work with stacks easily. It's used for various purposes, including function call management and expression evaluation.

## Algorithm:
Stack Algorithm:
1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. To push an element onto the stack:
   - Check if the stack is full.
   - If not full, add the element to the top of the stack.
3. To pop an element from the stack:
   - Check if the stack is empty.
   - If not empty, remove and return the top element from the stack.
4. To peek at the top element of the stack:
   - Check if the stack is empty.
   - If not empty, return the top element without removing it.
5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 as needed.
End of Stack Algorithm.
